## Hobbies

Actually, i have quite a few hobbies, but here's 2 of them

- Cycling: I SURE DO LOVE CYCLING. Anytime i feel bored and don't have any clue what to do, i'll hop on my bike and cycle around the town. I ride specifically roadbike, the one that maybe you have seen for a couple of times on the street. The one that can go pretty fast and take the half of the road:D

- Video Games: What do i do beside cycling? Yes, playing video games. I already played video games since i was 5 years old i think. Video games help me go through difficult times and basically it's my first hobby. I love playing action, RPG games and sports games such as Cyberpunk 2077, Fifa and my personally favorite game of all time: Assassin's Creed.

## Dream

I have 1 pretty unique specific dream that im trying to achieve. 

I want to have an Indonesian traditional food and drink restaurant that operates in multiple countries around the world. To be precise, i want to have an restaurant that serve indonesian food and drink but with a twist. The twist is, it will be cooked with local food-style where the restaurant at. For example, my restaurant in Japan will serve Sate padang but the sauce will be replaced by japanese curry sauce.
