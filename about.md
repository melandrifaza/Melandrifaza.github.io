title: About Melandri Rifaza 
---

Hi! Thanks for passing by. 

My name is Melandri Rifaza Ahmad Abudzar but usually people call me Faza. I was born and live in Jakarta for my wholeee life. As i'm writing this page, i am studying at Universitas Padjadjaran at Digital Business bachelor to be precise. I enjoy being here so far, the friends are cool and the lecturer are nice. Here in Digital Business i get to learn so many new things that i havent learned before in my highscool's year, such as programming, web developing (which what im doing right now), database system, and many more.
